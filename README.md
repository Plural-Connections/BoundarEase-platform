## Breakdown of repo

A quick explanation of main folders:

- `backend/` - database design (`models.py`), API scripts (`views.py`)
- `my-app/` - the frontend (react) files. `App.js` is the main file that stitches everything together.  Most of the remaining files correspond to React components
- `V9cscw040_supmat.pdf` - a PDF of the supplementary materials 

NOTE: we did not include the database scripts or data to keep the identity of the school district anonymous. Please reach out to coverney@mit.edu if you would like access to an anonymized version of the data.  
 
## Developing locally

### Frontend
- `cd my-app`
- (first time, to build dependences) `npm install`
- `npm start` to serve the front-end application (will default to port 3000)

#### To add new packages:

`npm install <package name>`

This is used when you want to use a react module that someone else has already developed.  You can find many of those [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/).

### Backend

- Create and activate a virtual environment in the root directory
- After activating the virtual environment, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root folder
- Manually create a `constants.py` file in the backend folder to include the following information

```
# Flask constants
SESSION_TYPE = "filesystem"
SECRET_KEY = TO FILL

# Other constants
GOOGLE_API_KEY = TO FILL
RANKING_MAPPING = ["diversity", "feeder_stability", "utilization", "travel"]
HASH_LEN = 10
MAX_REV_PER_TOPIC = 15
MIN_REV_FOR_TOPICS = 3
MIN_SCHOOL_FOR_TOPICS = 3
MAX_TOPICS = 10
```

#### Running backed server locally

`PYTHONPATH=. python backend/run.py` (will default to port 8888)

Test out that the API is running and that you can get data back by visiting the following in your browser: `http://localhost:8888/api/time` â€” it should return the unix timestamp of the current time (the code returning this is in `backend/views.py`)
